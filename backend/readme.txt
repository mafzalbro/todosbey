Creating an API!

1. got started using mongodb and mongoose as well as router = express.Router()
2. mongoose helps me to create new user using schema User with method const user = User.create({...})
3. index.js is main where routes defined and other files added using middleware method -> app.use(route, file path)
4. Used validations with express validator where i faced lots of problems with promises i.e. async await while CRUD operations using "mongoose"
5. bcryptjs used to password hashing (passkey + salt)
